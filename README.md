I am sorry it is long, but I wanted to show most of the game, I am really proud of it.

I learned a lot from making this game. Renpy was a perfect suggestion for me, I have struggled in this class to understand the code behind the scenes, so having a visual novel was the perfect way for me to learn about code execution and order and was way easier to identify issues. I did get stuck a few times – I messed with the folders on my laptop and basically broke my game, so I had to paste it into a new game file. The struggle was getting that backpack button to work. After watching a bunch of tutorials, I was finally able to get the button in. I definitely shot myself in the foot with putting so much in, I did not realize how much would go into making three monsters and a final. So, if it were smaller, I feel like I could have added more bells and whistles, but I am really happy that I got a completed story line.
A special thank you to TA Joanne Nichols for helping decide on the create your own story – I could not be happier with the outcome.
