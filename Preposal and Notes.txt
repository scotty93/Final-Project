# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am thinking about making a snake game where there are different colors or different shapes that will give the snake some ability - to shorten, or become invinsible for a short period
I really like Don't Starve and Stardew Valley, I would like to create a mod of some sort. Maybe a special food item or cooking instrument or meal.
I am also considering a choose your own adventure game. I love writing, and I am not the greatest at coding. So I think this would best
show the effort that I put in and not highlight my issues with programming.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Can I base the content of the choose your own adventure game from a childhood book?
I am still having trouble picturing the scope of the project. Like if I were to do a mod - am not really sure how to measure if 
it is significant enough for an A. Same for the Snake game - is just adding one special dot enough for an A or should I have a 
variety of dots that have different abilities. 

After some  thought I am between the Snake game with doing different color dots, I want them to be beneficial, but I want to throw one it that hurts the player.
I really like the idea of the create your own adventure, but I really need to see if its within my capabilities.





Need to comment what is my code, games website, raspberry pie, doesnâ€™t have to be python language

Whatever is in a readme file 
Add file, upload file, drag and drop to add file to repository, then press the commit button. Make sure it is public so that others can see.

Once you have everything set up, put in the website URL in canvas to submit our GitHub lab proposal.
